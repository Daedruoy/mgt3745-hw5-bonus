# Architecture

Status: ACTIVE in Module 4.

## Gate

**Feature:** F-01/F-02, a chair submits a time-sensitive update through a form; the system logs it with a timestamp and displays it in a current-items view, split by submission recency.

**Hard constraints:** zero budget, roughly one week, and limited ability to read code well enough to verify something I didn't build myself.

**Three options:** Hand-built, Existing-service, AI-assisted build.

**Scoring anchors (1–5, 5 always most favorable):** 1 = clearly fails this criterion for my situation, 3 = adequate with some tradeoff, 5 = clearly the best fit for my situation on this criterion.

| Criterion | Weight | Hand-built option | Existing-service option | AI-assisted build |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Cost to start | 3 | 3 (9) | 4 (12) | 4 (12) |
| Cost to maintain | 5 | 3 (15) | 2 (10) | 3 (15) |
| Time to working | 4 | 3 (12) | 4 (16) | 5 (20) |
| Inspectability | 4 | 5 (20) | 2 (8) | 2 (8) |
| Switching cost | 2 | 3 (6) | 2 (4) | 3 (6) |
| Fit to spec | 5 | 3 (15) | 2 (10) | 4 (20) |
| **Total** | | **77** | **60** | **81** |

**Sensitivity check:** if I raise Fit to spec's weight from 5 to 4, the totals become Hand-built 74, Existing-service 58, AI-assisted build 77. AI-assisted still wins, and the order of all three options doesn't change. The decision is not sensitive to that one weight moving by a point.

**Result:** AI-assisted wins, narrowly over Hand-built. Existing-service is clearly out, mostly because no generic template is likely to match the specific service that I require to help my chapter run smoother.

## The Gate: HW4 rerun

Where should entries live now that they must survive a cleared cache?

| Criterion | Weight | Build (Worker + D1) | Buy (hosted BaaS) | Delegate (AI builder hosts it) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cost to start | 2 | 4, real cost was time, not money; free tier, already done | 4, estimated, most BaaS have fast free-tier setup | 3, estimated, still requires prompting, review, and a second migration off what's already built |
| Cost to maintain | 3 | 3, free tier covers this project's scale; I now understand the code enough to fix it | 2, estimated, another vendor relationship and dashboard to track | 2, estimated, maintenance depends entirely on a tool I don't control and haven't tested |
| Time to working | 5 | 5, it's done and verified, working right now | 3, estimated, plausible but unverified | 2, estimated, would require abandoning the current working build and starting over on a new platform |
| Inspectability | 2 | 4, I read and debugged this Worker myself this week, real earned inspectability, not full mastery | 2, estimated, depends entirely on the vendor's abstraction | 1, honest low score, no experience reading what an AI-hosted builder actually generates or deploys |
| Switching cost | 2 | 2, scored from Session B experience: moving off localStorage took real hours, new commands, new debugging, a genuine cost | 2, estimated, likely comparable since another migration | 3, estimated, lower switching cost only because nothing has been built there yet, easier to walk away from a decision never made |
| Fit to spec | 5 | 5, the assignment requires this exact thing, a Worker + D1 built by hand this week, so fit is essentially guaranteed by requirement | 2, estimated, a hosted BaaS wasn't what the assignment specified, would likely require justifying a deviation | 2, estimated, the assignment explicitly frames this week's hand-build as separate from and prerequisite to any Delegate decision |
| **Weighted total** | | **76** | **45** | **39** |

## ADR-002: Entries move from localStorage to Cloudflare D1

**Status:** Accepted
**Supersedes:** ADR-001

### Context
Nu Mu chapter updates previously lived only in localStorage, tied to one browser on one device, and did not survive a cleared cache or follow a chair to a second device. That stopped being enough the moment more than one person needed to see the same updates: a chair posting from their phone and the secretary checking from a laptop need to see the same data, which localStorage cannot provide.

What crosses: every field a chair submits, chair name, chapter position, initiative, update title, and event or deadline date, leaves the browser and is stored in Cloudflare D1. To which vendor: Cloudflare, under their free-tier terms, in a region not chosen or controlled by me. Under what terms: no cost at this project's scale, governed by Cloudflare's standard terms of service. Who is accountable: I am. I created the database, hold the wrangler login token in this Codespace, and am responsible for what happens to chapter members' submitted data on Cloudflare's infrastructure.

### Decision
I will build the backend myself as a Cloudflare Worker backed by D1, rather than use a hosted backend-as-a-service or delegate hosting to an AI builder. This choice is scored in the Gate above: Build won with a real, tested implementation already working (76), well ahead of Buy (45) and Delegate (39), both of which were scored from estimation since I didn't try either this week.

### Alternatives considered
Buy (hosted backend-as-a-service): a service like Supabase or Firebase could plausibly host this data with less setup code. I did not try this, so its Cost to start and Time to working scores are estimates, not experience. It scored lower primarily on Fit to spec; this assignment specifically requires a Worker and D1 built by hand this week, so an off-the-shelf service would have required justifying a deviation from the assignment itself.

Delegate (AI builder hosts it): a tool like bolt.new could generate and host a backend from a prompt. I generally prefer AI-assisted builds, as stated in HW3. Still, I have no experience with a Delegate-hosted backend, and the assignment requires building this week's Worker by hand, so inspectability scored lowest here (1) for exactly that reason; I would have no way to verify what a Delegate-hosted backend was actually doing.

### Consequences
This makes trust and debugging easier: I read, wrote, and fixed real errors in this Worker myself this week, like the login timeout, the D1 binding check, and the validation logic, so I understand what's actually running.

Something got harder: deleting an entry is no longer possible from the UI. My HW3 version had a working delete button backed by localStorage; this week's Worker only implements GET and POST, since I chose not to build one under this week's time constraint. Chapter updates are now effectively permanent once posted, a real loss of functionality compared to HW3 that a future ADR will address if the chapter actually needs to correct or remove mistaken entries.

Also harder: offline use is now impossible. HW3 worked with no network at all; this week's version fails to load or save anything without a live connection to Cloudflare, which is a real tradeoff for a chapter tool brothers may want to check between classes with data or bad wifi.

Also worth noting: CORS is left open (`access-control-allow-origin: "*"`) rather than narrowed to a specific origin, since this Codespace's forwarded-port URL is not a fixed production address and would break for a grader running the page from a separate Codespace, per the README's own How to Run instructions. This trades a small amount of Craft-criterion tightening for actual reproducibility.

### Revisit trigger
Revisit this decision if the chapter's usage grows past what the free tier comfortably handles, if a real need for deleting or editing entries emerges, or if I gain enough experience with a Delegate-hosted option to score its Inspectability honestly rather than as an estimate.

## ADR-001

Title and date: ADR-001, 2026-09-17: Build the F-01/F-02 submission-and-log feature assisted by AI rather than buy an existing service or manually build out every feature.
Status: Superseded by ADR-002
Door / concrete acquisition and execution choice: AI-assisted, both this week's prototype and the eventual Notion dashboard, built and maintained with AI directly rather than an off-the-shelf template or an entirely hand-built model that I won't be able to fully flesh out in a reasonable time.
Context: Zero budget, a one-week window, and an acceptance of submission-based splitting, acknowledgment tracking without disclosing individual reasons, that generic templates aren't built for. I'm not yet strong at writing code, which weakens my ability to flesh out my model entirely by hand. Brothers have also reported that added burden from new tools is a real cost, not a hypothetical one, so long-term maintainability matters as much as getting something working this week.
Decision: I will build the F-01/F-02 feature assisted with AI rather than buy an existing service or fully manual, because time to working and Fit to spec outweigh the Inspectability of a Hand-built model.
Consequences and revisit trigger: This makes the output time of this tool much faster and will allow me to update it consistantly. My only trigger would be the handoff of this tool as the next president would require a large onboarding to be able to update the tool.

## The Gate: infrastructure tier (5C bonus)

Should Nu Mu Chapter Updates stay on Cloudflare Worker + D1, or graduate to Cloud Run?

Anchors: 1 = clearly fails this criterion for my situation, 3 = adequate with a tradeoff, 5 = clearly the best fit for my situation.

| Criterion | Weight | Stay: Worker + D1 | Graduate: Cloud Run |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Cost | 4 | 5 (20), experience: free for three weeks, no billing account involved | 2 (8), estimate: free tier exists but needs a billing account with trial credit, and a misconfiguration could cost money |
| Flexibility | 2 | 3 (6), experience: covers every endpoint I've needed, but limited to the Worker runtime | 5 (10), estimate: any language, any container |
| Complexity | 4 | 4 (16), experience: one file, one deploy command, though wrangler login resets were annoying | 2 (8), estimate: project, billing, build pipeline, and permissions before the first deploy |
| Your capability | 4 | 4 (16), experience: I wrote the PATCH endpoint and debugged the deploy failures | 2 (8), estimate: no prior GCP experience |
| Scale | 1 | 3 (3), estimate: free-tier request limits are far above one chapter's traffic | 4 (4), estimate: higher ceiling, which one chapter will not reach |
| **Weighted total** | | **61** | **38** |

**Sensitivity check:** if I raise the weights on Flexibility from 2 to 5 and Scale from 1 to 5, the totals become Stay 82 and Graduate 69. Stay still wins, so the decision doesn't hinge on how I weighted the two criteria Cloud Run is strongest on.

## ADR-003: Stay on Worker + D1; Cloud Run limited to a read-only dashboard experiment

**Status:** Provisional
**Relates to:** ADR-002 (not superseded; this ADR tests whether its hosting choice should change)

### Context
The chapter tool serves one chapter with a few dozen rows and a handful of users. The question is whether it has outgrown the free Cloudflare Worker and D1 setup. The course also requires Cloudflare to remain the backend regardless of this decision.

What crosses: to build the dashboard, a Cloud Run service will fetch the Worker's GET /entries response, which includes chair names, chair positions, update titles, and status. Those fields cross to Google Cloud when the service reads and renders them. To whom: Google Cloud, under a billing account on trial credit, in a region I choose at deploy time. Who is accountable: me. No Gemini API key or credential is placed in any repository.

### Decision
I will keep Worker + D1 as the backend. I will deploy one small Cloud Run service that reads from the live Worker and renders an HTML dashboard, as a test of the graduation path rather than a migration. The Gate favors staying (61 to 38) because cost, complexity, and my own capability all weigh heavily and all favor the Worker.

### Consequences
Staying means the tool cannot run long jobs, use libraries the Worker runtime doesn't support, or run containers. If the chapter ever wants a scheduled digest or anything computation-heavy, that will be harder here. Staying also means I finish this bonus without real experience of what Cloud Run costs to operate, since the deployment is a small experiment and not a production migration. The Cloud Run scores above are estimates, so this ADR is Provisional: after the build I will add a dated post-build note under it rather than editing the scores.

### Revisit trigger
Revisit if the tool needs something a Worker cannot do (a long-running job, an unsupported library, a container), if request volume approaches the Worker free-tier limits, or if more than one chapter starts using it.
